# 3D-complex-coordinate-plane
Interactive 3D Complex Function Grapher

This idea stems from the summer after my freshman year of high school, when I was taking Algebra II for fun!

The final result looks a bit different, thankfully.

The code is able to take in a custom complex function and plot the magnitude and phase.  There are also three pre-set functions that match those of Dan Durkin's 3D Grapher - Complex Functions in Desmos which I used to verify the accuracy of the grapher.
